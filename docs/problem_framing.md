# Problem Framing

## 1. Background
Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers, with a five‑year survival rate below 12%. More than 90% of pancreatic tumors carry mutations in the KRAS gene, and among these, **KRAS G12D** is one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging variants.
Despite decades of research, KRAS G12D has remained largely “undruggable” due to its shallow binding pockets, high conformational flexibility, and limited availability of validated inhibitors. Traditional drug discovery pipelines struggle to explore the vast chemical space required to identify novel binders for such a difficult target.

## 2. Scientific Challenge
KRAS G12D presents several obstacles:
- The protein lacks deep, well‑defined pockets for small‑molecule binding.
- Its conformational landscape is highly dynamic.
- Only a small number of known inhibitors exist.
- Classical generative models often fail to explore sufficiently diverse chemical space.
- Docking scores alone are not reliable without strong priors.
These challenges make KRAS G12D an ideal test case for **hybrid quantum–classical generative models**, which may explore chemical space differently from classical models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

## 3. Opportunity
Recent advances in:
- **Quantum machine learning**
- **Generative AI for molecular design**
- **Structure‑based drug discovery**
- **Large‑scale chemical datasets**
- **Hybrid quantum‑classical architectures**
create a unique opportunity to investigate whether quantum‑enhanced generative models can produce novel, diverse, and high‑affinity molecules for KRAS G12D.
This project explores that possibility.

## 4. Problem Statement
The central research question of this project is:

**Can quantum‑enhanced generative AI models design novel small‑molecule inhibitors for the KRAS G12D mutation that outperform classical generative approaches in diversity, novelty, and docking performance?**

## 5. Objectives
1. Build a modular pipeline combining:
   - data loading  
   - preprocessing  
   - generative modeling  
   - quantum modules  
   - docking  
   - scoring  
2. Train classical and quantum‑enhanced generative models.
3. Generate novel molecules conditioned on KRAS G12D structural information.
4. Evaluate molecules using:
   - docking scores  
   - ADMET predictions  
   - synthetic accessibility  
   - drug‑likeness metrics  
5. Compare quantum vs classical performance across:
   - novelty  
   - diversity  
   - binding affinity  
   - chemical validity  

## 6. Expected Impact
If successful, this project will:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
- Demonstrate a reproducible hybrid quantum–classical drug discovery pipeline.
- Provide insights into whether quantum models explore chemical space differently.
- Contribute candidate molecules for KRAS G12D inhibitor development.
- Offer a template for applying quantum AI to other hard‑to‑drug targets.

This framing defines the scientific motivation, the research gap, and the purpose of the entire project.
