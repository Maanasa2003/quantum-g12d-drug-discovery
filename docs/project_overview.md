# Project Overview

This repository contains code, data layouts, and documentation for a hybrid classical-quantum approach to drug discovery focusing on the G12D mutation target. The aim is to combine generative molecular models, quantum-enhanced modules, and classical docking/scoring pipelines to generate and prioritize candidate molecules.
