# Data Directory

This folder contains all datasets used in the project **Quantum‑Enhanced Generative AI for Drug Discovery Targeting KRAS G12D**.
To keep the repository lightweight and reproducible, **large datasets are not stored locally**.  
Instead, all datasets are accessed dynamically through Python scripts in `src/data_processing/`.

The directory is organized into three subfolders:
## raw/
Contains **raw, unprocessed data** exactly as retrieved from online sources.
Examples:
- KRAS G12D protein structures (PDB files)
- Known KRAS G12D inhibitors (SMILES/CSV from ChEMBL or PubChem)
- ZINC molecule batches (small samples, if saved)
- MOSES / GuacaMol raw CSVs (optional)
- ADMET datasets (Tox21, ADMETlab samples)
Raw data is kept untouched for reproducibility.

## processed/
Contains **cleaned, standardized, and model‑ready datasets**.
Examples:
- Cleaned SMILES lists
- Train/validation/test splits
- Filtered ligand sets
- Docking‑ready ligand files
- Preprocessed ADMET features
These files are generated by scripts in `src/data_processing/`.

## external/
Contains **external benchmark datasets** used for evaluation or comparison.
Examples:
- MOSES dataset (if downloaded)
- GuacaMol dataset
- ZINC subsets (if cached)
- Any third‑party datasets used for benchmarking
These datasets may also be loaded directly from URLs instead of being stored locally.

## Data Access Strategy
To avoid storing large files in the repository, this project uses **online data loading**.  
Python scripts in `src/data_processing/` fetch data from:
- RCSB PDB  
- PubChem  
- ChEMBL  
- ZINC  
- MOSES / GuacaMol  
- ADMET datasets  
This approach keeps the project lightweight, cloud‑friendly, and reproducible.

## Notes
- Only small sample files (if needed for debugging) should be stored here.
- Large datasets must **not** be committed to GitHub.
- Each data‑loading script should document the source and citation.

## Citations
Please cite the original data providers (PDB, ChEMBL, PubChem, ZINC, MOSES, etc.) when using their datasets in research outputs.
